title: Learn Everyday

So, I made a challenge with myself to learn a new thing every day, starting from today!

For now, I don't plan to do a make a study guide, planner or something like that. I'll just try to learn about a new topic
that I'm interested in that day.

With this, my goal is to follow a learning routine and also improve my ability to write in a structured manner in English, documenting the process here in this blog.

For sure, some days I'll learn something simple and in another days I'll learn something more complex. What's important is the consistency of doing this everyday (It's about the journey).
